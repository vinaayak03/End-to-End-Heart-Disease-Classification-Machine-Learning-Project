Heart Disease Prediction Model using Python

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical data. Using Python and libraries such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the goal is to develop an accurate classification model that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

The dataset used for this project contains various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators that are relevant for diagnosing heart disease. The data is analyzed to identify patterns and relationships that can help in predicting the presence of heart disease in individuals.

Key steps in the project include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. During data preprocessing, missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded appropriately. Exploratory data analysis is performed to visualize relationships among features and to understand the distribution of data.

Feature selection techniques are applied to identify the most significant features that contribute to heart disease prediction. Multiple classification models are trained using Scikit-learn, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness.

To run this project, ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The dataset should be placed in the project directory. Running the main script will perform data preprocessing, train the model, and display the evaluation results.

This heart disease prediction model provides a practical example of using machine learning techniques in the healthcare domain, highlighting the importance of data-driven decision-making. The insights gained from this project can be beneficial for further research in predictive analytics.
